      <description>I graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2020 and have since been working in the construction industry. I worked at IBI group out of school, had a brief sting at The Mitchell Partnership, and now work at GHD full time.&#xA;Many of the projects I work on are in the rail and transit sector, designing train and bus stations. I have previously worked on projects such as the Broadway Subway Project in Vancouver, the Eglinton Crosstown LRT and the Ontario Line Exhibition Station.</description>
