      <description>What is it? According to the GO DRM, all conditioned spaces inside of a GO station must be heated by a radiant floor heating system. This includes spaces such as the ambassador office, washrooms, retail space etc. However, this does not include auxillary spaces such as mechanical or electrical rooms.
