      <description>Here I dive into what I found out after reading about the SMT token, which exhibits the same problem that seems to plague the cryptocurrency industry in general.</description>

      <description>During my work I run into client requirements where the client requires an emergency ventilation system in a critical electrical or communication room. This system is meant to turn on when the main air conditioning system in this room becomes non-functional for whatever reason in the summer. Since these rooms tend to contain critical infrastructure, they must never be brought offline, which means the equipment is always generating heat.&#xA;In this scenario, we don&amp;rsquo;t want the room temperature to get too high while the A/C is being repaired.</description>

      <title>Radiant Floor Heating Systems in GO Stations</title>

      <description>What is it? According to the GO DRM, all conditioned spaces inside of a GO station must be heated by a radiant floor heating system. This includes spaces such as the ambassador office, washrooms, retail space etc. However, this does not include auxillary spaces such as mechanical or electrical rooms. For more detail, refer to DS-04.&#xA;Now what is a radiant floor heating system? In summary: it consists of heating a space by circulating hot water through pipes embedded in the floor slab, thus raising the slab temperature.</description>
