      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my work I run into client requirements where the client requires an emergency ventilation system in a critical electrical or communication room. This system is meant to turn on when the main air conditioning system in this room becomes non-functional for whatever reason in the summer. Since these rooms tend to contain critical infrastructure, they must never be brought offline, which means the equipment is always generating heat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, we don&amp;rsquo;t want the room temperature to get too high while the A/C is being repaired. Therefore, we design an emergency cooling exhaust fan that replaces in the room air with outside air to keep the temperature at some reasonable setpoint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
