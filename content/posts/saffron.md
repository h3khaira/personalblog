## Intro to Saffron
Recently I became aware of a cryptocurrency called Saffron.Finance (SFI) running on the Ethereum chain that its website claims is a "...peer to peer risk adjustment protocol. Users customize their risk and return profiles by selecting their own degree of exposure to underlying platforms."

The project seems to be run by a person who goes by the psudonym 'Dingo' and from initial appearances seems like a sophisticated cryptocurrency project with hefty ambitions. The website contains a [governance forum](https://gov.saffron.finance/), [a github page showing the source code](https://github.com/saffron-finance/saffron) and what seems to be great documentation on its goals and intents. There is even a "Saffron Academy Podcast" where host Dingo interviews prominent cryptocurrency figures.

## History
The first [commit](https://github.com/saffron-finance/saffron/commit/01daed0c4a8d589cc6f28c2a023bde5dd30d7b4c) to the Saffron github was on October 9, 2020, deep into the pandemic era, when many people had stimulus checks hitting their bank accounts and were bored at home. This was when a huge crypto boom was occuring, and NFTs were all the hype (which are curiously nowhere to be found now). The first commit was by the token's founded 'psykeeper', whos last commit to the project was 3 years ago in January 2021.
